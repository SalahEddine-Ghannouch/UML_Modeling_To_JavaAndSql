# UML Class Diagram Modeling and Code Generation Tool

![UML Class Diagram Tool Logo](https://github.com/IA24mad/UmlToJavaAndSql/assets/79339578/2945d02d-86e4-4dc4-8d1b-784bf58a6115)

## Description

This project proposes the design and implementation of a graphical and textual modeling tool for UML class diagrams, along with the automatic generation of Java, C++, and SQL code based on the created diagrams. The main objective is to provide a user-friendly and efficient environment for designing object-oriented software, utilizing the concepts and relationships defined by the UML modeling language. The tool incorporates a specific language (DSL) object defined under Xtext and JDOM for modeling and code generation.

## Features

- Graphical and textual modeling of UML class diagrams
- User-friendly interface for intuitive design and manipulation of class diagrams
- Support for creating classes, attributes, methods, and associations
- Definition of relationships such as inheritance, aggregation, and composition
- Automatic generation of Java, C++, and SQL code based on the created diagrams
- Error detection and prevention during code generation, reducing potential mistakes
- Time-saving automation of code generation process

## Installation

To use the UML Class Diagram Modeling and Code Generation Tool, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your_username/UML_Class_Diagram_Tool.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```shell
Import Project to Eclipse
```

## Usage

Upon launching the tool, you will be presented with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to create and manipulate UML class diagrams. Use the provided tools and controls to add classes, attributes, methods, and relationships to the diagram. The interface provides an intuitive environment for designing object-oriented software using UML concepts.

To generate code based on the created diagram, select the desired button (Java, C++, or SQL) and initiate the code generation process. The tool will automatically generate the corresponding code files, saving time and eliminating potential errors that may occur when creating code manually.
